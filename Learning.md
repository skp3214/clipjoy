# [**Why is This Different from Connecting to MongoDB in React (TS) vs. Next.js (TS)?**]()

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Next.js (Server-Side) vs. React (Client-Side)**
- **Next.js runs on the server**, so it can directly connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- **React (Frontend)** runs in the **browser**, so it **cannot** directly connect to MongoDB (because MongoDB doesn't expose a public API).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Serverless Considerations in Next.js**
- Next.js may run in **serverless functions** (e.g., Vercel), meaning a new instance of the app **could be created on every request**.
- This code **caches the database connection** (`global.mongoose`) to **reuse** the same connection, preventing **multiple redundant connections**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ How MongoDB Works in React (Frontend)**
Since React is client-side, you **cannot** connect directly to MongoDB. Instead, you:
1. **Create a Backend (API) in Node.js/Next.js** to handle DB operations.
2. **React calls the API via HTTP requests** (e.g., using `fetch()` or `axios`).
3. **The Backend (Express/Next.js API) handles the MongoDB connection** and returns data.

### **üöÄ Summary**
| Feature            | Next.js (Server) | React (Client) |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Can connect to MongoDB directly? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Needs an API to fetch data? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Uses a cached DB connection? | ‚úÖ Yes (for performance) | ‚ùå No |
| Can run in a serverless environment? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

**Next.js uses a server-side connection, whereas React (frontend) requires an API to interact with MongoDB.** üöÄ

### [Small Learnings]()
- **Next.js** runs on the server, so it can connect to MongoDB directly.
- **React (frontend)** runs in the browser, so it needs an API to interact with database.
- **Serverless Next.js** may create new instances on each request, so caching DB connections is crucial.
- In Next.js when you create api's, you need to use POST in place of post. Capitalization matters.
